List of great things I'd love to develop / add with my huge abudance of free time (in no particular order):
* [Contribute](https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-lint) to `ansible-lint` and add raw counts of warnings / failures
* [Contribute](https://github.com/pypa/pip) to `pip3` and add "Get latest version number of **package**"
* [Contribute](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) to `ansible` and add an option to shell/command to just PRINT THE OUTPUT. Seriously, why isn't this a feature?
* [Contribute](https://github.com/badges/shields) to `shields.io` and fix the Ansible Galaxy shields / add new shields for Ansible
    * Galaxy Role Name [(by name, instead of role number)](https://github.com/badges/shields/issues/286)
    * Galaxy Role Downloads 
    * Galaxy Collection Name
    * Galaxy Collection Downloads
* Make new Ansible-Lint and YamlLint Github action that isn't hugely broken and runs in reasonable timeâ„¢
* Contribute to (or otherwise make sane) the Bitwarden API and/or docs 
* Contribute to (or otherwise make sane) the BounCA API and/or docs
* Finish my HomeLab crazy galaxy project. Come up with some sane deployment order
* MaKe a bookmarking self-hosted solution that isn't awful
