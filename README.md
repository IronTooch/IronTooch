### IronTooch

I'm just a man, standing in front of a console, begging it to Lint.

I love all sorts of technology, but I'd be lying if I said that one particular technology doesn't have a special place in my heart...

List of great things I'd love to develop / add with my huge abudance of free time (in no particular order):
* [Contribute](https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-lint) to `ansible-lint` and add flag to get raw counts of warnings / failures, even on success
* [Contribute](https://github.com/pypa/pip) to `pip3` and add "Get latest version number of **package**"
* [Contribute](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) to `ansible` and add an option to shell/command to just PRINT THE OUTPUT. Seriously, why isn't this a feature?
* [Contribute](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) to `ansible` and make a module for "Pull latest release from Github"
* [Contribute](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) to `ansible` and clear up / Amend Composable to be able to add regular strings to compose command for inventory plugins

* [Contribute](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) to `ansible` and add "check" module to just get a boolean if something is in / matches command output
* [Contribute](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) to `ansible` `file` lookup plugin and add update for remote source
* [Contribute](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) to `ansible` `uri` module and add jquery seek to response so that register has value wanted

* Make API frontend for CoreDNS to add / change records
* Make new Ansible-Lint and YamlLint Github action that isn't hugely broken and runs in reasonable timeâ„¢. Fix mine (probably)
